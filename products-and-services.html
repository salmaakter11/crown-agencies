                <h2 id="ssy">Raw Cotton</h2>
                <p>Raw cotton refers to the unprocessed or minimally processed fibers obtained from cotton plants (Gossypium species). It is harvested from the cotton bolls, which are the seed pods of the cotton plant. Raw cotton consists of cotton fibers along with seeds and other impurities.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Here are some key points about raw cotton:</p>

                <img src="images/product/Raw Cotton/1654.jpeg  " width="250" height="200"
                    class="img_bdr img_rt"/>
                <img src="images/product/Raw Cotton/raw cotton 1.jpg" width="250" height="200"
                    class="img_bdr img_rt" />
                <img src="images/product/Raw Cotton/raw cotton.jpg" width="250" height="200"
                    class="img_bdr img_rt" />

                <br class="clearfloat" />
               
            <p>Fiber Structure: Raw cotton fibers are composed of cellulose, a complex carbohydrate that forms the structural component of the cotton plant. These fibers are typically long and twisted, giving them strength and flexibility.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Seed Content: Raw cotton contains cotton seeds, which are separated from the fibers during the ginning process. The seeds are usually removed to produce clean cotton fibers suitable for further processing.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Impurities: Raw cotton may contain impurities such as plant debris, dirt, leaves, and small twigs. These impurities are removed during the ginning process to obtain clean cotton fibers.</p>
                <br>
                <p>arieties: There are different varieties of cotton plants, each producing fibers with unique characteristics such as length, fineness, strength, and color. The most commonly cultivated cotton species include Gossypium hirsutum (upland cotton) and Gossypium barbadense (extra-long staple cotton, including Pima and Egyptian cotton).</p>
